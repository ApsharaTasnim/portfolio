        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Introduction</h4>
        <p>Codingal asked me to prepare a portfolio using scrollspy,carousel using Bootstarp.But,I dont have a complete
            portfolio yet.So,I prepared sliders based on my dreams and my beginning of this exciting journey og learning
            something.The title of my portfolio is "My beginning".Then,I have mentioned my dreams one by one.I use my
            most of the time on these things besides my bookish knowledge.My skills are important not only for mr but
            for everyone to live a healthy life with lots of enjoyment and recreation.So,I have explained my hobbies
            here.Hope you all will enjoy reading them.</p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">My Beginning</h4>
        <p>I have started learning a lot of things from my childhood.This dream to learn new new things and to be able
            to stand at a different position from others comes from my mon.I believe it is still my beginning to learn
            new things anf to implement them.So ,I have named this so-called portfolio as "My beginning."</p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">My dreams</h4>
        <p>These skills are also my dream.I think acquiring different skill will help me to achieve my dream.Again,its
            my dream to be familiar with innovative things,so we can call them "My dream".Dreams can help us to process
            emotions and memories, and can also inspire creativity and provide self-knowledge. Even though the exact
            mechanisms and functions of dreams are still not fully understood, understanding their importance and
            interpreting them can enhance our quality of life.
            Dreams may help people learn more about their feelings, beliefs, and values. Images and symbols that appear
            in dreams will have meanings and connections that are specific to each person. People looking to make sense
            of their dreams should think about what each part of the dreams mean to them as an individual.</p>

        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Drawing</h4>
        <p>By having the opportunity to put them out on a piece of paper, it gives us the chance to see clearly, to
            improve what we envision and to a point, be more creative. By practicing drawing and painting, we are given
            the chance to be in touch with our emotions very uniquely compared to any other human activities.The
            significance of drawing are-
        <pre>
    a) Enhance your communication skills.
    b) Boost your creativity.
    c) Optimise your memory function.

        <!-- dancing -->
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">Dancing</h4>
        <p>Dance activates multiple brain regions including areas responsible for problem solving, physical coordination
            and emotions. Dancers it seems, may very well have discovered the fountain of youth, with long term wellness
            possible through the combined physical and mental benefits of dance.Dancing is also a great way to reduce
            stress. It provides you an outlet using which you can deal with your feelings and anxieties. And the
            happiness hormones, endorphins, that release as a result of dancing contribute towards making you feel
            better about yourself and your life as a whole.

        <!-- singing -->
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading6">Singing</h4>
        <p>There's an increasing amount of evidence that singing releases endorphins, serotonin and dopamine – the
            'happy' chemicals that boost your mood and make you feel good about yourself.Some people are born with a
            natural ability due to genetics and seem to find a perfect pitch easily. But broadly speaking, singing is
            more of a learned skill than a natural one. Most people who can sing well learn how to do so at some point
            in their lives.

        <p>The activity or hobby of making decorative objects with your hands: I enjoy crafting, especially quilting.
            the activity of skillfully creating something such as a story: So much care went into the crafting of the
            narrative.Research has shown that crafting, regardless of the medium you use, can bolster mood, improve
            self-confidence, and reduce stress overall.

        <!-- crocheting -->
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading8">Crocheting</h4>
        <p>Crochet is a craft technique that involves using a hooked needle to create fabric by interlocking loops of
            yarn or thread. It is similar to knitting, but instead of using two needles, crochet uses a single hook.For
            individuals, crochet offers a range of mental and physical benefits. It is a form of mindfulness, which
            helps to reduce stress and anxiety by promoting relaxation and calming the mind. Crochet is also a
            low-impact hobby that can be done while sitting down, making it a good choice for people with limited
            mobility.

        <!-- reading and writing -->
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading9">Reading & Writing</h4>
        <p>Reading allows learners to focus on details, think critically, and reflect on their learning process, while
            writing enables learners to process information in a broader and deeper way. These skills are essential for
            long-term memorization, comprehension depth, practicality, and expression correctness.Literacy encompasses
            both reading and writing, which are critical for students to analyze, synthesize, and communicate complex
            ideas in upper grades. This dual focus on reading and writing is essential to prepare students for the
            academic challenges of secondary education and beyond.

            sport helps children learn to control their emotions and channel negative feelings in a positive way.
            Playing sport helps children build resilience and feel better about themselves.Sport offers a national
            identity, uniting countries nationally and internationally, it can be used to shape values and morals within
            society. Sports can also breakdown social barriers, stereotypes and prejudices.The 10 most popular sports
            globally are soccer, cricket, basketball, hockey, tennis, volleyball, table tennis, baseball, golf, and
            American football.

        <!-- coding -->
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading11">Coding</h4>
        <p>Coding tells a machine which actions to perform and how to complete tasks. Programming languages provide the
            rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based technologies.Computers only understand binary
            language. On the other hand, humans cannot work with binary language at a level more than simple addition or
            subtraction. Therefore, we have developed high level programming languages to interact with the computer.
            <br>

            Computers only understand binary language. On the other hand, humans cannot work with binary language at a
            level more than simple addition or subtraction. Therefore, we have developed high level programming
            languages to interact with the computer.In programming, we first write a program in high level programming
            language like C++, Java, etc. After writing the program, we compile it. After compilation, a machine code is
            generated. The machine code is in binary language and thus understood by the computer. So, Coding works in
            three steps namely writing program in high level programming language followed by compilation and then
            execution of the compiled binary code.
        <pre>
      There are several benefits of coding.
      a) It helps in developing logical thinking.
      b) It helps in developing creativity.
      c) It helps in developing problem solving skills.
      d) It helps in developing critical thinking.
      e) It helps in developing communication skills.
      f) It helps in developing teamwork skills.
